# Call-Roulette
An app to make calling more fun when bored


''' Call Roulette '''
Call Roulette is a fun and interactive Android application that brings an element of surprise and spontaneity to your daily communication. The app randomly selects contacts from your phone's contact list and allows you to initiate calls or messages with them, creating unique and unexpected conversations.

'''Functionality'''
1. Random Contact Selection
Call Roulette randomly picks a contact from your phone's contact list, ensuring each interaction is unpredictable and exciting.

2. Private Call Option
You can enable the "Private Call" feature, which adds a twist to the communication. When selected, the app will make the call using a private number (e.g., "141" followed by the contact's phone number).

3. Shuffle Contacts
Before starting the roulette, the app shuffles your contacts to ensure a fair and unbiased selection process.

4. Number Neighbours
Add an extra layer of randomness by enabling "Number Neighbours." The app generates additional phone numbers by incrementing the selected contact's phone number by a specified value.

5. Blacklist Contacts
You have the option to blacklist certain contacts to avoid calling or messaging them in the future. This feature allows you to personalize the Call Roulette experience to your preferences.

6. Countdown Timer
The app includes a countdown timer, adding suspense and anticipation before each communication.
