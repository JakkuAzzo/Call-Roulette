   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/Users/nathanbrown-bennett/AndroidStudioProjects/MyApplication/app/src/main/res/drawable-v24: Warning: This folder configuration (v24) is unnecessary; minSdkVersion is 24. Merge all the resources in this folder into drawable. [ObsoleteSdkInt]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

/Users/nathanbrown-bennett/AndroidStudioProjects/MyApplication/app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher.webp: Warning: The resource R.drawable.ic_launcher appears to be unused [UnusedResources]

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

/Users/nathanbrown-bennett/AndroidStudioProjects/MyApplication/app/src/main/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher.xml:2: Warning: The application adaptive icon is missing a monochrome tag [MonochromeLauncherIcon]
<adaptive-icon xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
^

   Explanation for issues of type "MonochromeLauncherIcon":
   If android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in your manifest, you must
   either remove the reference to android:roundIcon if it is not needed; or,
   supply the monochrome icon in the drawable defined by the android:roundIcon
   and android:icon attribute.

   For example, if android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in the
   manifest, a launcher might choose to use android:roundIcon over
   android:icon to display the adaptive app icon. Therefore, your themed
   application iconwill not show if your monochrome attribute is not also
   specified in android:roundIcon.

/Users/nathanbrown-bennett/AndroidStudioProjects/MyApplication/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.webp: Warning: The image ic_launcher.webp varies significantly in its density-independent (dip) size across the various density versions: mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.webp: 341x341 dp (512x512 px), mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.webp: 512x512 dp (512x512 px), mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.webp: 256x256 dp (512x512 px), mipmap-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.webp: 171x171 dp (512x512 px), mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.webp: 128x128 dp (512x512 px) [IconDipSize]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDipSize":
   Checks the all icons which are provided in multiple densities, all compute
   to roughly the same density-independent pixel (dip) size. This catches
   errors where images are either placed in the wrong folder, or icons are
   changed to new sizes but some folders are forgotten.

/Users/nathanbrown-bennett/AndroidStudioProjects/MyApplication/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.webp: Warning: The ic_launcher.webp icon has identical contents in the following configuration folders: drawable, mipmap-hdpi, mipmap-mdpi, mipmap-xhdpi, mipmap-xxhdpi, mipmap-xxxhdpi [IconDuplicatesConfig]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDuplicatesConfig":
   If an icon is provided under different configuration parameters such as
   drawable-hdpi or -v11, they should typically be different. This detector
   catches cases where the same icon is provided in different configuration
   folder which is usually not intentional.

/Users/nathanbrown-bennett/AndroidStudioProjects/MyApplication/app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher.webp: Warning: Found bitmap drawable res/drawable/ic_launcher.webp in densityless folder [IconLocation]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLocation":
   The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such
   as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to drawable-mdpi and
   consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in drawable-ldpi,
   drawable-hdpi and drawable-xhdpi. If the icon really is density independent
   (for example a solid color) you can place it in drawable-nodpi.

/Users/nathanbrown-bennett/AndroidStudioProjects/MyApplication/app/src/main/java/com/example/myapplication/MainActivity.kt:270: Warning: Do not concatenate text displayed with setText. Use resource string with placeholders. [SetTextI18n]
        totalContactsText.text = "Total Contacts: $totalContacts"
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/Users/nathanbrown-bennett/AndroidStudioProjects/MyApplication/app/src/main/java/com/example/myapplication/MainActivity.kt:270: Warning: String literal in setText can not be translated. Use Android resources instead. [SetTextI18n]
        totalContactsText.text = "Total Contacts: $totalContacts"
                                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "SetTextI18n":
   When calling TextView#setText
   * Never call Number#toString() to format numbers; it will not handle
   fraction separators and locale-specific digits properly. Consider using
   String#format with proper format specifications (%d or %f) instead.
   * Do not pass a string literal (e.g. "Hello") to display text. Hardcoded
   text can not be properly translated to other languages. Consider using
   Android resource strings instead.
   * Do not build messages by concatenating text chunks. Such messages can not
   be properly translated.

/Users/nathanbrown-bennett/AndroidStudioProjects/MyApplication/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml:11: Warning: Hardcoded string "Total Contacts: 0", should use @string resource [HardcodedText]
        android:text="Total Contacts: 0" />
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "HardcodedText":
   Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several
   reasons:

   * When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or
   portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when
   making changes)

   * The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding
   new translations for existing string resources.

   There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a
   resource lookup.
